Hi, i'm a software engineer and open source enthusiast.

The character <RubyAnnotation lang="zh" rt="jǐng">井</RubyAnnotation> means "well" or "hash" in Chinese. Both "octothorpe" and "hash" refer to the "#" symbol. Since GitHub's mascot is called "Octocat", I combined them to create "octohash". The reason GitHub didn't use this name is because it was already taken.

After watching live streams by <MagicLink username="antfu" text="Anthony Fu" />, I was captivated by the charm of open source. With the desire to learn from the programmers I admire, I joined the open source community.

A few things about me:

- MBTI: INFJ (though it might not be accurate since I didn't want to pay for the test and found the questions too tedious)
- Pets: <RubyAnnotation rt="Nàonào">闹闹</RubyAnnotation> (British Shorthair), <RubyAnnotation rt="Máomáo">毛毛</RubyAnnotation> (Teddy), and <RubyAnnotation rt="Niángāo">年糕</RubyAnnotation> (orange cat who went to cat heaven, but I'll always remember him)
- <RubyAnnotation rt="Xenoblade">JRPG</RubyAnnotation> and <RubyAnnotation rt="Fire Emblem">SRPG</RubyAnnotation> enthusiast, and I'm a fan of <RubyAnnotation rt="Don't Like MHWilds">Monster Hunter</RubyAnnotation>. I love Baldur's Gate 3 and looking forward to Divinity

As someone who grew up in <RubyAnnotation rt="Beijing">北京</RubyAnnotation>, if you're currently working or living here, perhaps we can hang out together or code together.
